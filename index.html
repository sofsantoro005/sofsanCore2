                    “Century follows century, and things happen only in the present.
                </a>
                There are countless men in the air, on land and at sea, and all that really happens happens to me.”

                “I leave to various future times, but not to all, my garden of forking paths.”

                “The phrase ‘to various future times, but not to all’ suggested the image of bifurcating in time, not in space.”

                “In all fiction, when a man is faced with alternatives he chooses one at the expense of the others...”

                    Not for nothing am I the great-grandson of Ts’ui Pen. He gave up temporal power
                    to write a novel and to create a maze in which all men would lose themselves.
                </a>
                His novel had no sense to it and nobody ever found his labyrinth.
                I imagined a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing maze which would take in
                both past and future. The Garden of Forking Paths.
                An invisible labyrinth of time.
                The book and the labyrinth were one and the same.
                I leave to various future times, but not to all, my garden of forking paths.
                The phrase suggested the image of bifurcating in time, not in space.
