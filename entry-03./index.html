                    Not for nothing am I the great-grandson of Ts’ui Pen. He gave up temporal power
                    to write a novel and to create a maze in which all men would lose themselves.
                </a>
                His novel had no sense to it and nobody ever found his labyrinth.
                I imagined a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing maze which would take in
                both past and future. The Garden of Forking Paths.
                An invisible labyrinth of time.
                The book and the labyrinth were one and the same.
                I leave to various future times, but not to all, my garden of forking paths.
                The phrase suggested the image of bifurcating in time, not in space.
